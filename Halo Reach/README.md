# Halo: Reach Manual for [Manual for Archipelago](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual)
Halo: Reach is a first person shooter game developed by Bungie, published by Microsoft, and released in 2010. You fight against overwhelming odds in a battle to defend the human colony planet known as Reach.

## Which version do I need?
This Manual was designed with **The Master Chief Collection** in mind. However, the original 2010 release is also an option.
You do not need the entire MCC just to play Reach, you can buy it on its own on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1064220/Halo_Reach), or you can play it if you have [Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) for PC or Xbox.

## What is the objective of this game?
Complete the last mission of the game, The Pillar of Autumn.

## What is randomized?
Armor abilities, access to missions (in the form of "access codes", for lack of a better term), most weapons, and Skulls.
You start with both the Assault Rifle and the Magnum, since most if not all missions will have either as a starting weapon.

## What is the logic of this game?
Since every level can be selected from the start (in MCC and in the original release after you complete the campaign), most levels will connect with the first level, Winter Contingency, with the exception of The Pillar of Autumn (the last level, mostly to try and balance out the logic so we don't get extremely short runs that end very early) and Lone Wolf (it's mostly a playable epilogue, so I found it better to have it as an independent mission).
In addition to this, Skulls can be mixed in, so you will have to enable them as you get them

### What should I do once I get a skull?
There are two ways to approach skulls and the Increase Difficulty trap:
1. Immediately exit back to the Campaign menu, turn on the skull, and start the level again. If you reached a Rally Point before you obtained the skull, you can choose to start from there if you wish.
2. Keep playing the mission you're currently in, and once you finish it, go back to the Campaign menu, enable the skull, and start the next level you have access to.

## What is considered a location check in this Manual?
- Missions, broken down into their Rally Points. It's 3 Rally Points per mission, with the exception of New Alexandria and Lone Wolf; these missions have only one Rally Point.
- (Optional) The first 9 Data Pads, which do not require you to play on Legendary difficulty.
 - (Optional) Legendary Data Pads, one in each main mission and in Lone Wolf.
- (Optional) The Par Time and Score on each mission, which might be different on the original and MCC versions. You can check [Halopedia](https://halopedia.org) for more information. The Master Chief Collection shows the par time and score in the campaign select screen; you can enable Time/Score displays in this menu as well (Competitive Score is the recommended option).
- (Optional) Achievements relevant to Campaign Mode.

### What are Rally Points?
Rally Points are a checkpoint that can be accessed directly from the Campaign menu to place you directly in a specific point in a mission.
Most missions have 3 Rally Points, with the exception of New Alexandria and Lone Wolf, which only have one.
Rally Points are laid out like this:
- **Rally Point Alpha**: The start of the mission
- **Rally Point Bravo**: Some point at roughly 35% of the mission
- **Rally Point Charlie**: Somewhere around 65-70% of a mission
For example, in Winter Contingency, the Rally Points are:
- Alpha: The Pelican drop in the hills (the start of the mission)
- Bravo: Right after fighting the group of Elites, where you start driving the truck
- Charlie: At the holdout outside the communications outpost
Documentation of Rally Points TBA

## Installation
1. Grab the latest release of [Manual](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual/releases) and copy the .zip file to your `worlds` folder (`X:\ProgramData\Archipelago\lib\worlds` by default)
2. Grab the latest release of this Manual, and copy it to the same folder, overwriting any previous versions if there are any.
    - Unzipping is not necessary; it will work, but you might have to delete any loose folders if you choose to unzip the Manual.
3. In the **Archipelago Launcher**, you should now see an option named "Manual Client". Launch this client and fill in the information needed.
    - No tests were performed on the former standalone client. It should work, regardless.

## FAQ
### I can't open the Manual, it gives me a "The Manual client can only be used for Manual games"
If this happens, it means that the Manual name is not set up properly. The correct name should be `Manual_HaloReach_Mintz` (case sensitive).
### Generation errors
You might not have enough locations to accomodate the amount of items you're trying to randomize.
