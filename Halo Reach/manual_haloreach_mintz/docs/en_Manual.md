# Halo: Reach

## What is Halo: Reach?
Halo: Reach is a first person shooter game developed by Bungie, published by Microsoft, and released in 2010. You fight against overwhelming odds in a battle to defend the human colony planet known as Reach.

## What does randomization do to this game?
You specify your list of "items" and "locations", and Archipelago will randomize your items across your world and others, and items from this world and others into your locations. Essentially, anything you can use or that progresses your goal can be an item. Anything you can check can be a location. If multiple people are playing the same game as a Manual game, they can all have different items and locations.

## What is the goal of a Halo: Reach when randomized?
Complete the last mission of the game, The Pillar of Autumn.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Armor abilities, access to missions (in the form of "access codes", for lack of a better term), most weapons, and Skulls.
You start with both the Assault Rifle and the Magnum, since most if not all missions will have either as a starting weapon.

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?
You don't. There is no mod. The tasks of marking locations as checked and limiting your items used based on items received is all performed by you (the player) while using the Manual client and its accompanying tracker.
